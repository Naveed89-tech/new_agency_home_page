# News Agency Home page

This is a project to practice HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What i have learnt?

- During Developing this project,the most difficult situation arise when i start using CSS Grids, variable and custom media queries.
- For using grids, it was difficult to use minimum css custom properties as well as responsive ones.
- Custom queries done with custom coding and most common device sizes. The project support upto 280px device size.
